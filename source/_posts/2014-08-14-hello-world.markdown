This is a Hello World article. Recently I'm visiting Gottingen in German. Despite a lot of spare time I have, I have wasted most of that on Rubbish on Internet. I think we should leave ourselves more time to think and mediation. We are just tooooo occupied by the unneccessary things.

I wish to blog and and write down my thoughts and feelings. But I wonder if I can do that, for the time and days I have are almost the same.
